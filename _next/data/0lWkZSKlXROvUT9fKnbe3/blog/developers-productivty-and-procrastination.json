The deadline of a task, project or duty comes around sooner or later. Then after being high on adrenaline and pulling a couple of all-nighters, we manage to survive and deliver what we easily could have done without that much stress.\n\n### The cause\n\nBy personal experience, I think procrastination has 3 major causes.\n\n#### 1. Your value system\n\n_“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” - Friedrich Nietzsche_\n\nWhy are you doing this task? What will you achieve? What is your goal? money? social validation? whatever the reason might be, you have to go through this personal conversation with yourself.\n\nTry to unbderstand your why, then and only then, you will be able to bear its how.\n\n#### 2. Fear\n\nWe are scared of the unknown and ambiguity, just like how children fear darkness.\n\nOur brains are wired for survival and passing genes to the next generation. That is the ultimate goal of any living being.\n\nOur natural instinct could not care less about getting straight A's in final exams or learning that hot new technology.\n\n#### 3. Distraction\n\nreduce the noise/ distraction\n\n### The cure\n\nLimit your targets\nRemove the delay for execution\nGain momentum\nIf it ain't SMART, Make it\nPomodoro technique\nKnow when to quit"},"__N_SSG":true}
