{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Lessons learned migrating large scale legacy vue application","date":"2021/12/05","excerpt":""},"slug":"lessons-i-learned-migrating-legacy-frontends","content":"\n### Prefer changing existing code rather than writing from scratch unless you absolutely have to do so.\n\nalways double check underlying principles are at place,we wanted to migrate our all-new crs that was written with vue 2 and webpack to vue 3 and vite and our company dls\nwe had a lot of problems such as prop drilling, design incosistency etc\nI tried to rewrite one of our views about supplier crud actions from scratch, my estimated time for the task was one week. It took three to finish with fixing a lot of bugs on the period\nI learned somethings important, when migrating code especially if the requirements are the same as before and there's nothing to drasitaclly change (e.g. changing monolithic to microservices) improve upon code that exists. the heavy lifting is already done. you can deliver faster with higher quality that isn't rushed\n\n### Don't be afraid to ask questions, embrace humility.\n\nyou can't know it all, you have to decide how much of a generalist you want to be, and how much of a specialist you wanna be.\n\nWhile I was busy migrating the code base, I did not know the answer to a lot of my questions. I learned to constantly ask other teams about solutions, alongside my own research.\n\n### Be aware of the limitations / pitfalls of your framework / language\n\nyou are not able to figure skate on a platfrom made for basketball.\n\nDeclarative programming without a good side-effect management story is just imperative programming with more steps\n\n### Without domain knowledge, you will not be using 100% of your technical skills\n\nNo matter how good you are in your tech stack, you need domain knowledge to use it.\n\nDomain knowledge lets you foresee problems that haven't occured yet and fix them before hand, whether it is the implementation of complex UIs or the archtitecture design of a mongo database schema.\n\nTake time to know the bussiness, ask questions, set meetings. remember you're only here to support your bussiness.\n\n### Get in touch with users\n\nask about their needs and achieve first-class feedback directly from them.\n\nIt always feels good when your direct users thank you for your app's features, and it is actually eye opening to see how exactly they intract with it and what they expect from it.\n\nbest case scenario is where developer can afford regular meetings with users and stakeholders and collect a list of todos which will be added in near future!\n\n### Automate what can be automated during the migration e.g. process of SVG optimizing\n\none more example of automation was an optomization pipeline for our SVG components. I developed a little script that I run to generate Optimized SVG components to lazy load them where I need them.\n\nThe task is to have SVG files on one specefic directory from our design team\n\n<!-- <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Mhdi-kr/3aca7c6fb7d36d1c732bc30786a12d4e.js\"></script> -->\nfeed them into svgo package and save the results in a vue file into another directory that we expect\n\nI used vs-code find-and-replace tool to swap several of our components used over our entire project. It was about some components with different props and different tag names. You could only imagine how much It would have taken if I were to do it by hand\n\n### start by laying the first brick - start small and be consistent\n\nMigrating a working panel is daunting, especially to a newer vesion of the library you use to make it work but the fact of the matter is chopping up this big task into smaller, doable sub tasks and focus on them one at a time untill there's no subtask is left\n\nyou can eat an ele[hant one peace at a time, lay the bricks until the wall is done\nfast iteration, fast correction, fast devlivery will get you trhough hell.\n\n### Do not overwork yourself, take breaks to sharpen your axe\n\nI am passionate about my job. I don't count the hours till the day finishes. also I like the social validation I get from moving my tasks from to-do to done on our kanban board\n\nbut, every one has limited amount of energy and mentall capacity each and every day and this is just a fact. I think you should be aware of that.\n\n### Premature optimization is the root of all evil\n\npassionate developers tend to over-engineer stuff. in addition to that we crave optimization in our desings and developments. it seems so exciting to us and we spend so much time on it that we actually forget about the product itself. our nperzumber one goal should be to deliver. premature optimzation means posponing delivery in favor of making the prefect code whcih is fairy tale.\nBut overengineering is an important part of learning\nI agree fully. However, question is whether production code is the right place for experimenting.\nI learned that perfect code is not written over night. it's not a linear path to perfection. rather than onions. software dev is like onion. you have layers upon layers of iteration over the same thing to make it better each and ervery day. like a painter that brushes over the same canvas over and over again that it becomes mona lisa\n\n-   effective communication with other team memebers\n-   delegate when you can - it is more more about knowing what to say no to than what to do next\n-   duplicate code is much better than wrong abstraction\n-   Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them\n\nA good researcher is sometimes better than an expert.\n\n### take responsiblity and burry your burden\n\ntake responsibility and get to work. stop blaming legacy code, previous developers or decisiions made before you. it is all gone and past. you're the player now, you're the one every one will blame, or praise. the choise is yours and yours only.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
