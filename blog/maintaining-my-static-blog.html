<p>I always wanted to have a personal blog, <a href="/blog/developers-productivty-and-procrastination">but never actually put the time in to get it done</a>.</p>
<p>Creating meaningful blog posts is not an easy task, might as well have systems and tools in place helping us do it faster and easier.</p>
<p>I tried many different ways and flavors of blogging. Wordpress was heavyweight and clunky, Medium or other micro-blogging services did not just feel <em>right</em> to me. Naturally as a web developer, I wanted to have something of my own and make it from scratch.</p>
<h2>Github pages</h2>
<p>I made a repository on Github to host all of the code needed for the blog. Then used the Github pages free service to serve the HTML files available on the repo.</p>
<p>As a cherry on top, you can use Cloudflare's free services to point the <code>YOUR_USR.github.io/YOUR_REPO</code> to your custom domain <code>YOUR_DOMAIN.co.uk</code> for example.</p>
<p>That's exactly what I did to <code>Mahdikarimi.com</code> and pointed it to <code>mhdi-kr.github.io/personal-blog</code> using Cloudflare and my domain provider settings.</p>
<h2>Next.js, Filesystems and Markdown parsers</h2>
<p>This website was built upon the Next.js React framework. I've developed React components layout and stylings. The actual content of the blog posts are written in Markdown format in a specific directory inside the repo.</p>
<p>Next.js allows you to acess filesystems in serverside configuration using the <code>fs</code> object available in Node js.
The <code>getStaticProps</code> function is called by Next.js when the page is first loaded. It is then used to fetch the markdown content using Nodejs filesystem.</p>
<p>After fetching the actual content as strings we need to parse it using a Markdown parser and pass it onto the components as state props for react to do its magic.</p>
<h2>Sky is the limit!</h2>
<p>You can do all sorts of cool things with Markdown files! You can hide any metadata inside it files called <em>Frontmatter</em>. Your markdown parser will provide it to you and you can use it to embed dates, tags or arbitrary static state in your blog posts!</p>
<p>Using that state in React, you can conditionally hide/show your posts, render tags or dates, etc! Sky's the limit.</p>
<h2>Generating static HTML, CSS and JS files</h2>
<p>By using the <code>next export</code> command in the terminal, we can render all the HTML, CSS and JS files we need for the website to be up and running without a runtime in the <code>/out</code> directory. This is great because this is all we need for Github pages!</p>
<h2>Publishing changes without hassle</h2>
<p>Let's publish the generated files to Github Pages. I use the <code>gh-pages</code> CLI utility,<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages"> available on NPM</a>, to publish the static files to a specific branch.</p>
<p>Github automatically detects push-events to this branch and then deploys my newly created HTML and assets files to the web!</p>
<h2>All in one go!</h2>
<p>You can aggergate all the steps I talked about in one single command, or even register it as a NPM command to run every time you want to publish your blog.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Bash">
$ yarn build &amp;&amp; yarn export &amp;&amp; touch out/.nojekyll &amp;&amp; gh-pages -t -d out

</code></pre>
<h2>Handling comments</h2>
<p>Any form of content creation requires a feedback loop to bring value to its users as well as authors.</p>
<p>The problem with Github pages for handling comments is that everything is static. You don't have access to a database on it to be able to do CRUD operations.</p>
<p>Of course there are workarounds for those kinds of tasks but I wanted something elegant and fast. This is where utterances comes into play.</p>
<p>With utterances Github app you can have fully functional comment section in your posts! It uses Github issues under the hood and I could easily integrated this with React.</p>

The deadline of a task, project or duty comes around sooner or later. Then after being high on adrenaline and pulling a couple of all-nighters, we manage to survive and deliver what we easily could have done without that much stress.\n\n## The cause\n\nBy personal experience, I think procrastination has 3 major causes.\n\n### 1. Your value system\n\n_‚ÄúHe who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.‚Äù - Friedrich Nietzsche_\n\nWhy are you doing this task? What will you achieve? What is your goal? money? social validation? whatever the reason might be, you have to go through this personal conversation with yourself.\n\n Our brains are wired for survival and passing genes to the next generation. That is the ultimate goal of any living being. Our natural instinct could not care less about getting straight A's in final exams or learning that hot new technology, unless you couple it with some value deep within your psyche.\n\nTry to understand your why, then and only then, you will be able to bear its how.\n\n###  2. Fear\n\nWe are scared of the unknown and ambiguity, just like how children fear darkness. \n\nWhen we don't know completely what we are dealing with as a challenge, a classic trick our brain does is to try to avoid it by sticking to short term pleasure, but here's when you have to intentionally interfere with this natural response.\n\nAfter gaining momentum, that fear will be gone and you will have no problems doing that work again.\n  \n\n###  3. Distraction\n\nWe live in a society prone to distraction. We're constantly called on social apps, emails and other matters thanks to the internet.\n\nWe cannot get rid of distraction entirely, but the thing we most certainly can do is _reducing the possibility of being distracted_ when we are actively working.\n\nThere are many systems, apps and tools you can facilitate to reduce the amount of distraction you receive per day.\n\n## The cure\n\nI wrote about the potential reasons why you might be procrastinating. Now let's see how we might be able to get decrease it.\n\n### Remove the delay for execution\n\nThe more time you take to prepare, the less likely you are to finish the task at hand.\n\nThere's a famous quote by Warren Buffett saying \"An idiot with a plan can beat a genius without a plan\", personally as a professional \"over-thinker\". this is not a case for me.\n\nI've seen times and times again that when I get to work without that much planning I am quicker gain feedback and to change course and keep moving step by step. Hipfiring my way through success if you will.\n\n### Gain momentum\n\nNewton's first law states that if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.\n\nI've experienced the same concept can be applied to human actions. If you're not doing anything and are lazy to start things, chances are you are going to be that way unless you gain momentum towards what you want to do.\n\nSame principle applies to people that are motivated and high performer. They are more likely to keep doing what they are already doing.\n\n### Try SMART goals\n\nWhile planning ahead of time, try to set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time.-bound goals.\nSMART goals have the attributes that will help you have less friction towards starting, doing and finishing your tasks.\n\n## Pomodoro technique\n\nSimply put, you set an alarm for 10-15 minutes, you get to work and discard any distractions or any multitasking. 15 minutes of laser focusing on one task. After that you take a 5-10 minute break. Repeat this process multiple time and you will get so much out of your day!\n\nPomodoro technique is effective because you limit all of your friction. It is only 10 minutes! it is going to be fun! But there's a compound effect to it. which will pay off soon.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"memory management in arduino","excerpt":"How to handle precious memory in embeded systems and MCUs","date":"2022/02/25","tags":["Embeded","C++"],"show":true},"slug":"memory-management-in-arduino","timeToRead":"1 min read","content":"\n### Random access memory types\n\n#### SRAM\n\nStatic Random Access Memory\n\n#### EEPROM\n\nElectrically Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory\n\n#### Flash memory\n\n### Possible optimizations\n\n#### Software\nuse `PROGMEM` \nwhat it does is \n```cpp\nconst dataType variableName[] PROGMEM = {}; // use this form\n```\n\n#### Serverside\n\nDo the heavy lifiting on the server. provide lightweight interface for arduino to work with.\n\n### Problems ahead\n\n#### Memory fragmentations"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Large-scale Vue 3 Migration: Lessons Learned","excerpt":"I will discuss what I learned migrating a large-scale vue application, Improved developer's experience and maintainability.","date":"2021/12/05","tags":["Life","Frontend","Vue.js"],"show":true},"slug":"lessons-i-learned-migrating-legacy-frontend","timeToRead":"6 min read","content":"\nWhen I joined the hotel team in Alibaba Travels Co. I was tasked to maintain and migrate CRS (Central Reservation System) panel. It was developed using Vue 2.6, Webpack, bootstrap-vue UI component library. There used to be a lot of issues. It had zero tests, There were a lot of technical issues and anti-patterns such as prop-drilling and excess use of mixins, etc. We were in dire need of a big change.\n\nThere were a lot of ups and downs, but after 4 or 5 months we were able to replace Vue 2 to Vue 3, Webpack to Vite, configured cypress and testing environments, resolved breaking changes, last but not least, migrate ALL of the used SFC components to use a totally different UI component library with different props, design and behaviour!\n\nAll of it happened in the same git repository but in a different branch! Just like natural selection, I knew we could not afford to do things from scratch. This is how we get to my first point here.\n\n### Always prefer changing existing code rather than re-writing from scratch\n\nThere was a lot of code that I could reuse in the migration without any problems such as the custom date and currency plugins and utils, cloud integration API calls, reusable general components that existed in the codebase, etc.\n\nI tried to do as little change as possible in terms of removing whole code sections or components and rewriting them, but I have to admit sometimes you just cannot do it.\n\nI tried to rewrite one of our views about supplier crud actions from scratch, my estimated time for the task was one week. It took three to finish, fixing a lot of bugs in the same period. I learned something important, when migrating code especially if the requirements are the same as before and there's nothing to drastically change (e.g. changing monolithic to microservices) improve upon code that exists. the heavy lifting is already done. you can deliver faster with higher quality that isn't rushed.\n\n### Premature optimization is the root of all evil\n\nAlways implement things when you need them, never when you just foresee that you _might_ need them\n\npassionate developers tend to overengineer stuff. furthermore, we crave optimization in our designs and developments. it seems so exciting to us and we spend so much time on it that we forget about the product itself. our number one goal should be to deliver value to the business. premature optimization means postponing delivery in favor of making the perfect code/architechture which is a fairy tale. \n\noverengineering is an important part of learning. However, the question is whether production code is the right place for experimenting or not.\n\nI learned that perfect code is not written overnight. it's not a linear path to perfection. It is like it is layered. The nature of software development is of an onion. You have layers upon layers of iteration over the same thing to make it better every day. Like a painter that brushes over the same canvas over and over again that it becomes _Starry night_.\n\nAlways question yourself on why you're doing things you're doing and if that decision you're making is going to limit your future-self or librate\n\n_\"Duplicate code is much better than the wrong abstraction\" | Addy Osmani_\n\n### Take responsibility and burry your burden\n\nGet to work. stop blaming legacy code, previous developers, or decisions made before you. It is all gone and past. You're the player now, you're the one everyone will blame or praise afterwards. The choice is only yours.\n\n### Know your limitations\n\nBe aware of the limitations and pitfalls of your framework or language of choice\n\nyou are not able to figure skate on a platform made for basketball.\n\nDeclarative programming without a good side-effect management story is just imperative programming with more steps\n\n### Embrace humility\n\nAt the time of migration, I did not know the answer to a lot of my questions. I learned to constantly ask other teams about solutions and suggestions, alongside my own research.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions, You can't know it all. As a general rule of thumb you have to decide how much of a generalist you want to be, and how much of a specialist you want to be.\n\n### Gain domain knowledge as soon as possible\n\nWithout domain knowledge, you will not be using 100% of your technical skills\n\nNo matter how good you are in your tech stack, you need domain knowledge to use it.\n\nDomain knowledge lets you foresee problems that haven't occurred yet and avoid them beforehand, whether it is the implementation of complex UIs or the architecture design of a mongo database schema.\n\nTake time to know the business, ask questions, set meetings. remember you're only here to support your business.\n\n### Get in touch with users\n\nIt always feels good when your direct users thank you for your app's features, and it is eye-opening to see how exactly they interact with it and what they expect from it.\n\nThe best-case scenario is where a developer can afford regular meetings with users and stakeholders and collect a list of todos that will be added in near future!\n\n### Effective communication with other team members\n\ndelegate when you can - it is more about knowing what to say no to than what to do next\n\n### Automate what you can\n\ne.g. process of SVG optimizing\n\none more example of automation was an optimization pipeline for our SVG components. I developed a little script that I run to generate Optimized SVG components to lazy load them where I need them.\n\nThe task is to have SVG files on one specific directory from our design team\nfeed them into SVGO package and save the results in a Vue file into another directory that we expect\n\nI used vs-code find-and-replace tool to swap several of our components used over our entire project. It was about some components with different props and different tag names. You could only imagine how much It would have taken if I were to do it by hand\n\n### Start small and be consistent\n\nMigrating a working panel is daunting. Chopping up this big task into smaller, doable sub-tasks and focus on them one at a time until there's no subtask is left.\n\nyou can eat an elephant one peace at a time, lay the bricks until the wall is done.\n\nfast iteration, fast correction, fast delivery will get you through hell.\n\n### Beware of burnout\n\nI am passionate about my profession. I don't feel time passing by when I'm working, but, everyone has a limited amount of energy and mental capacity each and every day and this is just a fact.\n\nJust take breaks to sharpen your axe. Make sure you have enough physical resources, food and sleep to keep you going.\n\nTake a great care of yourself and health, because it is priceless."}],"post":{"frontmatter":{"title":"maintaining my statically generated tech blog","excerpt":"How I manage to maintain this blog using Notion, Next.js and Github Pages","date":"2022/03/14","tags":["Frontend"],"show":true},"slug":"maintaining-my-static-blog","timeToRead":"4 min read","content":"\n\n  \n## My story\nI always wanted to have a personal blog, [but never actually put the time in to get it done](/blog/developers-productivty-and-procrastination). \n\nCreating meaningful blog posts is not an easy task, might as well have systems and tools in place helping us do it faster and easier.\n\nI tried many different ways and flavors of blogging.

I use the `gh-pages` CLI utility,[ available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages), to publish the static files to a specific branch.\n\n  \n\nGithub automatically detects push-events to this branch and then deploys my newly created HTML and assets files to the web!\n\n\n  \n\n## All in one go!\n\n  \n\nYou can aggergate all the steps I talked about in one single command, or even register it as a NPM command to run every time you want to publish your blog.\n\n  \n\n```Bash\n\n$ yarn build \u0026\u0026 yarn export \u0026\u0026 touch out/.nojekyll \u0026\u0026 gh-pages -t -d out\n\n```\n\n## Handling comments\n\nAny form of content creation requires a feedback loop to bring value to its users as well as authors.\n\nThe problem with Github pages for handling comments is that everything is static. You don't have access to a database on it to be able to do CRUD operations. \n\nOf course there are workarounds for those kinds of tasks but I wanted something elegant and fast. This is where utterances comes into play. \n\nWith utterances Github app you can have fully functional comment section in your posts! It uses Github issues under the hood and I could easily integrated this with React.\n\nMake sure you [checkout their documentation for more details!](https://utteranc.es/)"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"maintaining-my-static-blog"},"buildId":"KNZbV0tCCiJDdzfQCIeAE","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
