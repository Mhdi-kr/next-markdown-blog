### The cause

Fear. In my opinion the root cause of laziness and prcorastination is fear.

we are scared of the unknown.

Our goals do not meet the SMART criteria.

we should evaluate why we are doing it

we should put business first

reducing the noise

### The cure

Limit your targets
Gain momentum
If it ain't SMART, Make it
Pomodoro technique
Know when to quit
